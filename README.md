# hello-world
Li Dongfeng's first Github test project.

This is the first time I use Github.
Formerly I used GIT on a self-managed Linux server,
and then the server could not use fixed IP address any more so I stopped it, 
and I use GIT on my laptop only,
but I used a repository backup,
and use Baidu cloud to backup my repository.

Github's free service can only be public projects, 
it's a big constraint.
